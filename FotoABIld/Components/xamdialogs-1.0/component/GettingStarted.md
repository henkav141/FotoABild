Custom dialogs for picking dates and simple lists

## Usage ##

Both the `XamSimplePickerDialog` and `XamDatePickerDialog` dialog classes are based on `XamDialogView` which can easily be sub-classed to create your own custom dialogs.  

Currently there are two standard dialogs, though more are planned in the future.

- Date Picker
- Simple list picker

### XamDialogView ###

`XamDialogView` is the base class for the pre-defined dialogs and for your own sub-clasess.  It contains properties for showing, hiding and configuring the dialogs which are detailed below.  

#### Properties ####

 - Title
  - Gets/Sets the title of the dialog
 - TitleLabelTextColor
  - Gets/Sets the Color of the title label. Also sets the colour of the button text
 - Message
  - Gets/Sets the message of the dialog
 - MessageLabelTextColor
  - Gets/Sets the color of the message label.
 - SubmitButtonText
  - The text to appear on the submit button
 - CancelButtonText
  - The text appear on the cancel button
 - BlurEffectStyle
  - The type of blur effect to use
 - ConstantUpdates
  - Gets/sets whether the value you be updated constantly or just on submit
 - ButtonMode
  - Mode for the display of the Cancel/Submit buttons(Both, Cancel only or Submit Only)
 - DisableBackgroundOverlay
  - Disable the overlay that covers the content underneath the dialog
 - BackgroundOverlayColor
  - Set the color of the overlay that covers the content underneath the dialog
  
#### Methods ####

 - Show
  - Show the dialog
 - Hide
  - Hide the dialog
  
#### Events ####

 - OnCancel
  - Called when the cancel button is pressed
  
The submit event is provided on the sub-class as it will be typed to the data that matches the type of dialog.

### XamSimplePickerDialog ###

`XamSimplePickerDialog` is a dialog with a simple UIPickerView with a single component.  This can be used to present a simple list.  

To create the picker simply provide the constructor with a list of strings to display.

			var dialog = new XamSimplePickerDialog(new List<String>(){"Ringo","John","Paul", "George"})
			{
				Title = "Favorite Beatle",
				Message = "Pick your favorite beatle",
				BlurEffectStyle = UIBlurEffectStyle.ExtraLight,
				CancelButtonText = "Cancel",
				ConstantUpdates = false,
			};
				
			dialog.OnSelectedItemChanged += (object s, string e) => 
			{
				Console.WriteLine(e);
			};

			dialog.SelectedItem = "John";

			dialog.Show();

You can also use an awaitable static method called `ShowDialogAsync` to show the dialog and await the result.  

			var result = await XamSimplePickerDialog.ShowDialogAsync("Who are you?","Select your name", new List<String>(){"Dave","Rob","Jamie"}, "Rob");
			Console.WriteLine(result);
#### Properties ####

 - SelectedItem
  - Gets/Sets the selected item
 - ValidateSubmit
  - Gets/Set function to handle validation of the selection on submit

#### Events ####

 - OnSelectedItemChanged
  - Called when the selected item has changed, if `ConstantUpdates` is true, or when the submit button has been clicked.  
  

### XamDatePickerDialog ###

`XamDatePickerDialog` is a dialog with a `UIDatePicker` view embedded into the dialog.

To create the picker simply provide the constructor with the `UIDatePickerMode` setting, to set the mode of the `UIDatePicker`  

			var dialog = new XamDatePickerDialog(UIDatePickerMode.DateAndTime)
			{
				Title = "Date Picker",
				Message = "Please Pick a date and time",
				BlurEffectStyle = UIBlurEffectStyle.ExtraLight,
				CancelButtonText = "Cancel",
				ConstantUpdates = false,
			};
				
			dialog.SelectedDate = new DateTime(1969,7,20,20,18,00,00);

			dialog.ButtonMode = ButtonMode.OkAndCancel;

			dialog.ValidateSubmit = (DateTime data)=>
			{
				return true;
			};

			dialog.OnSelectedDateChanged += (object s, DateTime e) => 
			{
				Console.WriteLine(e);
			};

			dialog.Show();

You can also use an awaitable static method called `ShowDialogAsync` to show the dialog and await the result.  

			var result = await XamDatePickerDialog.ShowDialogAsync(UIDatePickerMode.DateAndTime,"Date of Birth","Select your Date of Birth", new DateTime(1969,7,20,20,18,00,00) );

			Console.WriteLine(result);

#### Properties ####

 - SelectedItem
  - Gets/Sets the selected item
 - ValidateSubmit
  - Gets/Set function to handle validation of the selection on submit

#### Events ####

 - OnSelectedItemChanged
  - Called when the selected item has changed, if `ConstantUpdates` is true, or when the submit button has been clicked.  
  
## Sub-classing ##

`XamDialogView` is an abstract class, allowing you to easily sub-class it to produce your own dialogs very easily, as demonstrated by the `CustomDialog` in the sample.  

You will need to implement three abstract methods and a single property, which are detailed below.  Addtionally your constructor will need to call the base `XamDialogView` constructor that takes an `XamDialogType` value.  

#### Methods ####

 - CanSubmit
  - Determins if the submit can be processes
 - HandleCancel
  - Called when the cancel button is pressed
 - HandleSubmit
  - Called whe the submit button is pressed
  
#### Properties ####

 - ContentView
  - Returns the custom `UIView` to be embedded into the Dialog
